# MoonWalk.jl

MoonWalk.jl is a Julia package for simulating stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on rotation groups. It provides tools for modeling Brownian motion, cage dynamics, and escape dynamics.

## Features

- Simulate Brownian motion on rotation groups.
- Model brownian, cage and escape dynamics with customizable parameters.
- Visualization of trajectories, mean squared displacement (MSD), and Frobenius distance.

## Installation

To install the package, clone the repository then precompile it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainljsimon/MoonWalk.jl
```
